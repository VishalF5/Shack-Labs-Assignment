# Approach for Semantic Textual Similarity :

1. Sentence Encoding :

   Universal Sentence Encoder : The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high dimensional vectors that can be used for text classification,            semantic similarity, clustering, and other natural language tasks. The pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder is publicly available in Tensorflow-hub.



2.  Cosine Similarity: Cosine Similarity computes the similarity of two vectors as the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. So if the angle between the vectors is 0 degrees, then the cosine similarity is 1.
